# Ti-84-CE-Essentials
A Collection of Software and games to keep you occupied in a slow math class.

This is a compliation of iconic games and the tools required to run them on a Ti 84 CE Calculator. I did not create any of the software in this repo by myself, and am not its orignal creator, this is simply a compilation to easily get set up with familiar games on a new device.

To install these games on a Ti-84 CE you will need the Ti Connect CE software available on the Texas Instruments website.
You will also need to make sure your calculator OS is able to run ASM programs correctly. Some newer OS versions might need a jailbreak in order to run these programs.
If this is the case I would reccomend arTIfiCE. From my own experience this jailbreak has run smoothly and has been able to run ASM programs smoothly. For more information and the download link visit https://yvantt.github.io/arTIfiCE/.

A note on Cesium:
Cesium is a shell that can be installed that neatly organizes all your games into one place, and is extremely customizable. I reccomend installing Cesium first before any other games.
